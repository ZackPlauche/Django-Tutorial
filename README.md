# Django-Tutorial
Showcase completion and understanding of Django Framework

# Why I Completed This
I completed this tutorial to showcase I now have some skill & experience with the Django Framework. :)

I've been wanting to get into Web Development with Python to build my own website, I chose to learn Django and web development as my first specialty because pretty much every field that I've been wanting to learn (Data Science, AI, Machine Learning, Automation, etc.) is only useful with other programming languages unless you can get it up on a website.

From here, there's still a lot for me to learn, and honestly as I type this I feel a little late to the game.

However this is only the beginning of my expertise in this area.

The next step from here is to build my service offering and portfolio website.

Thank you for reading.

Bye for now.*
